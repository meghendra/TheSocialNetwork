# The Social Network 
This is one of my undergraduate projects, basically a social networking web application built on top of a Windows, Apache, MySQL and PHP stack. The web application is capable of securely loging users in and out. It allows guests and users to view profiles of other members. It enables it's users to create profiles which are publicly visible. User passwords are stored as MD5 hashs format in its database for security purposes. The system uses PHP and MySQL, which are open source and are used extensively on the internet.
